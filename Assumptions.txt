1. Customer : Pet = 1:1
2. IoT device/Cellular Tranmitters will be registed as part of registration process for the customer/pet.
3. Location Data is stored as logitude, Latitude in Database
4. IoT Device/Cellular Transmitters send data over HTTP to Rest API
5. Location from Cellular Transmitters will be updated automatically every 5 mins (more the frequency, more burden on the location update service * DB)
6.History/Searches are on UserEvents 
7.
